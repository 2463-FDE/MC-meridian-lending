    REPLACE_WITH_POSTGRES_PASSWORD placeholder, and an operator can set
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD but leave the DSN on that placeholder or a stale value —
    /health would read healthy while the first real query fails auth. So this
    also rejects known placeholder/stub tokens and, when POSTGRES_PASSWORD is
    present as the source of truth, requires the DSN password to match it,
    catching placeholder/stale drift without a DB round trip.

    Residual (documented): this proves the password is real and consistent, not
    that it authenticates. A wrong password with no POSTGRES_PASSWORD to compare
    (e.g. an external managed DB whose secret lives only in the DSN) needs a live
    connectivity probe — a follow-up. Passwordless auth (IAM/peer/PGPASSWORD)
